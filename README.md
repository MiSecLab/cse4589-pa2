# CSE 4/589: Programming Assignment 2 (PA2) AutoGrader
If you have landed at this repository directly, you first should read up on bit of a background [here](https://cse4589.github.io/).

## Introduction
PA2 AutoGrader runs completely on the system that it is invoked from and does not require any server-side setup.

The [_Grader_](/Grader) directory holds the grader source and usage instructions.

The [_Template_](/Template) directory contains the source for the code template distributed to students (see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o6epHif2H0--Qhq9uo1dp0tXel5CiSYoYsuFa-s92YU/pub)).

## Notes
* The results of the simulator may be different on different systems. If you want to verify the results submitted by the students in their reports, you should provide a host/machine to students to run their simulations.
